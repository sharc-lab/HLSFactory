This project helps to run Vitis HLS on standalone task cpp files generated by TAPA/Pasta for a AutoNTT-H design.

Directories:
cpp/ - cpp files for each task and header file. This is generated during TAPA/Pasta run.
tcl_template/ - Contains tcl file template to run Vitis HLS
src/ - This directory contains files required to convert TAPA based function headers to HLS. This is copied from Pasta repo: https://github.com/SFU-HiAccel/pasta-hybridbuffer/tree/main/tapa/src

How to run:
<Set your Vitis environment>
make run_hls target=TASK_NAME

TASK_NAME is same as the cpp file name without the .cpp extension.
